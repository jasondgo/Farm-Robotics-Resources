# Description

Source Code file includes information over: 

* Program for X-Drive



# Background Knowledge

Recommended to have an understanding of the basics of c++.

Recommended that you go through Motor Basics, Motor Sensing, Motor Control, and 6 Motor Tank Drive. 

It is a **MUST** that you watch the corresponding video with this file. Nothing in the source code explains the math behind
creating an X-Drive. This is done in the video only, since there is some background information that would be hard to explain in 
comment format.
