# Begin Here

The repository holds a multitude of example programs in VEXcode. These programs are geared towards introducing the functionality of motors and sensors, as well as the specific implementation of sensors and motors into different drivetrains and subsystems. Many projects are heavily commented, meaning there is a lot of description in the program so that anyone can read through it. Some files are not heavily commented, and in that case, you should check out the associated video with that project on my YouTube channel, where I go through the entire program. Also, the files that are heavily commented have associated YouTube videos that you should check out if you don't feel like reading or want further insight.
