# Preface

The example programs build off of each other, so the order that you view them is important.
Although, some programs build off previous ones more so than others, it is recommended that you follow
the order or have the necessary background knowledge to skip around.

Each example program folder has a README.md which provides a description of what concepts are introduced/shown 
in the source code as well as what background knowledge, if any, is recommended to go through the example program.

There are youtube videos that go along with these files. It is highly recommended that you check out the corresponding
video before going through the source code on your own.
